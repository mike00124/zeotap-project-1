The weather monitoring system is a network of sensors, devices, and other
technologies that are used to collect and analyse data about the weather. This system can be
used to monitor a variety of weather-related parameters, such as temperature, humidity,
atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. The collected data is then sent to a central hub, where
it can be processed and analysed to provide real-time information about the weather.
